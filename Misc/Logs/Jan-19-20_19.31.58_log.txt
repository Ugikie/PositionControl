help drawnow
  <strong>drawnow</strong> Update figure windows and process callbacks
      
  drawnow updates figures and processes any pending callbacks. Use this
  command if you modify graphics objects and want to see the updates on the
  screen immediately.
  
  drawnow limitrate updates figures, but limits the number of updates to 20
  times per second (20 fps). If it has been less than 50 milliseconds since
  the last update, or if the graphics renderer is busy with the previous
  change, then the new updates are discarded. Use this command if you are
  updating graphics objects in a loop and do not need to see every update
  on the screen. Skipping updates can create faster animations. Pending 
  callbacks are processed, so you can interact with the figure during
  animations.
  
  drawnow nocallbacks updates figures, but defers callbacks such as
  uicontrol clicks until the next full drawnow command. Use this option if
  you want to prevent callbacks from interrupting your code.
  
  drawnow limitrate nocallbacks limits the number of updates, skips updates
  if the renderer is busy, and defers callbacks.
  
  drawnow update skips updates if the renderer is busy and defers
  callbacks.
    Note: This syntax is not recommended. Use the limitrate option
          instead.
 
  drawnow expose updates figures, but defers callbacks.
    Note: This syntax is not recommended. Use the nocallbacks option
          instead.
